# Configuration

## Windows Configuration Instructions

1. Set HOME environment variable to cygwin installation like this:

    G:\cygwin64\home\sgnezdov

2. Make sure that this directory is

    $HOME\vimfiles

3. Add cygwin's bin to system path:

    G:\cygwin64\bin

because vim plug-in manager needs to use git.
